## MS to Beats

The purpose of this device is to help producers to precisely time parameters displayed in milliseconds and seconds. It aims to do so by converting the millisecond (or second) value to how much beats such a value represents with the current BPM of the Live set. Hence the title MS (milliseconds) to Beats.

For example if a producer wants to adjust the release parameter of a compressor, they would see that at 120 BPM, 15ms equals to 1/128 of a bar. Observe:
